# Code poems

This is just an idea that I have had for awhile that I wanted to play with. The
idea is just that you write little programs that are poetic to a sense. I just
want to start documenting my thoughts along this line becuase there could be
something nice here.

## Forms
I am hoping to try a few different versions of this: 
+ Programs that do compile but don't do anything (they will just look correct)
+ Programs that compile, run, and print the actual poem but contain basic
  abstractions
+ Very interactive experiences that try to get at the divide between man and
  machine
  + Think text adventures that are abstract, vague, and mysterious but will
    present an interesting end-result
    
I think that the best place to start here is with the first concept and see what
kind of room there is to adventure.

## Languages
Chosen language for the first set of tests will be Ruby becuase of it's inherent
expressiveness.

I think that there could be some interesting sort of products that are produced
with lisp.

`(or (to be) (not (to be)))` 

These kind of word asesrtion soups could maybe be interesting but they would
require that the reader be up on lisp which will limit the audience pretty
aggressively.

Other languages to consider: 
+ Javascript
+ Python
+ make my own
